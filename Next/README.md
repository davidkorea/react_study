# Next.js

- all React and Vue app are SPA, single page application
  - because the all Components are binded to `index.js`
  - this will lead load page slow
  - all web content will be imported into index.html with js file
    - not for SEO
    
- SSR, server side render
  - this will help to SEO search engine optimize
  - better for load first page
